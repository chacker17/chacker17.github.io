                        Hello! My name is Catrina Hacker and I am a PhD student in the <a href = "https://www.med.upenn.edu/ngg/" target="_blank">Neuroscience Graduate Group</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. 
                        My research interests lie at the intersection of computational, cognitive, and systems neuroscience with broad interests in population coding, neural networks, and learning and memory. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I am doing my thesis work in Dr. Nicole Rust's <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/psych/rust-lab/" target="_blank"> Visual Memory Lab </a> where I'm studying how dynamic brain processes support our ability to remember what we see.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I am passionate about science communication and enjoy sharing my enthusiasm for neuroscience through writing. Check out the <a href="writing.html">writing page</a> to read some of my recent pieces.

                <span class = "title"><b>A little bit about me....</b></span>
                <span>
                    <p> I graduated from the University of Southern California in May 2019 with a Bachelor&#8217s degree in neuroscience. While at USC I worked on several projects aimed at uncovering neurocomputational accounts of face recognition. I also worked in a songbird lab where I helped develop an experiment that coupled real-time behavioral evaluation with optogenetic stimulation in juvenile zebra finches. In August 2019 I joined the University of Pennsylvania&#8217s Neuroscience Graduate Group where I've been working with Dr. Nicole Rust. You can read more about my research <a href = "research.html">here</a>.</p>
                    <p> When I&#8217m not in the lab I enjoy playing board games, <a href="https://www.pennmedsymphony.com/" target="_blank">making music</a>, and immersing myself in a good book.</p>
