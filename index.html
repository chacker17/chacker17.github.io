                        Hello! My name is Catrina Hacker and I am a fourth-year PhD student in the <a href = "https://www.med.upenn.edu/ngg/" target="_blank">Neuroscience Graduate Group</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. 
                        My research interests lie at the intersection of computational, cognitive, and systems neuroscience with broad interests in population coding, neural networks, and learning and memory. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I am doing my thesis work in Dr. Nicole Rust's <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/psych/rust-lab/" target="_blank"> Visual Memory Lab </a> where I'm studying how our recent visual experience shapes visual recognition memory. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I enjoy writing about neuroscience. Check out the <a href="writing.html">writing page</a> to read some of my recent blog-style posts.

                <span class = "title"><b>A little bit about me....</b></span>
                <span>
                    <p> I graduated from the University of Southern California in May 2019 with a Bachelor&#8217s degree in neuroscience. While at USC I worked on several projects aimed at uncovering neurocomputational accounts of face recognition. I also worked in a songbird lab where I helped develop an experiment that coupled real-time behavioral evaluation with optogenetic stimulation in juvenile zebra finches. You can read more about my undergradaute work <a href = "research.html">here</a>. In August 2019 I joined the University of Pennsylvania&#8217s Neuroscience Graduate Group where I've been working with Dr. Nicole Rust. </p>
                    <p> When I&#8217m not in the lab I enjoy playing board games, listening to music, playing the viola and piano, watching movies, and immersing myself in a good mystery.</p>
