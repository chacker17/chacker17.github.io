                        Hello! My name is Catrina Hacker and I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania. 
                        My research interests lie at the intersection of cognitive, systems and computational neuroscience with a specific interest in the visual system. 
                    </p>

                <span><p>
                    I graduated from the University of Southern California in May 2019 with a degree in neuroscience. 
                    While at USC I worked with Dr. Irving Biederman in the Image Understanding Lab where I led several projects aimed at uncovering neurocomputational accounts of face recognition. 
                    I also worked in the Bottjer Songbird Lab with Dr. Sarah Bottjer where I helped develop an experiment that coupled real time behavioral evaluation with optogenetic stimulation in juvenile zebra finches. 
                    In August 2019 I joined the University of Pennsylvania&#8217s Neuroscience Graduate Group.
